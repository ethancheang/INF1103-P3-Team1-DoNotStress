"""Evidence questionnaire v3: question config and the reflection safety check.

Source: donotstress_question_evidence.docx, 9 October 2026, section 2.
Every question uses one 1-5 scale except typical sleep, which stays a
0-14 hour slider (half-hour steps) and is converted to 1-5 only when
scoring. logic_manager owns scoring, context flags and factor cards.
Items are adapted from their source instruments, so results are NOT
PSS-4, PSQI, IFDFW or MSPSS scores. Positively worded items (reverse=True)
are scored as 6 - answer, so a higher scored value always means more
stress. Never convert legacy /10 or evidence-v2 records onto
this scale.
