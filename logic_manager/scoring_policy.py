    """The numbers behind the stress score and the tiers.

    The defaults are the Phase 1 rules (logic_rule "v3"):

    * pss_2, pss_3 and the two support items are positively worded, so they
      are scored as 6 - answer.
    * Sleep hours become 1-5: 8+ h -> 1, 7 to <8 -> 2, 6 to <7 -> 3,
      5 to <6 -> 4, under 5 -> 5.
    * Tiers: Low below 2.5, Moderate 2.5 to 3.5 inclusive, High above 3.5.
    * Gemini's score must be within 0.01 of Logic's.

    To try other numbers, pass a different policy to ScoreCalculator; no
    class has to change (Open/Closed). The policy checks itself when it is
    created, so a typo cannot quietly produce wrong scores.
