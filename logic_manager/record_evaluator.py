    For every record it:
      1. checks the record's fields                    (EnrichedRecord)
      2. works out Logic's own score                   (ScoreCalculator)
      3. cross-checks Gemini's score, within 0.01      (else ScoreMismatchError)
      4. runs every business rule the same way         (BaseEvaluator objects)
      5. picks the final tier, tips and factor cards   (TipPlanner, FactorCardBuilder)

    Logic never replaces Gemini's score with its own. Its own score is kept
    only as an audit value (``logic_stress_score``).

    Relationships with the objects it uses:
      * aggregation: the rules are created outside and handed in. They exist
        on their own and can be reused (tests and other managers do).
      * association: the ScoreCalculator is also used by AIScoreVerifier.
        LogicManager uses it but does not own it.
      * composition: the TipPlanner and FactorCardBuilder are created here,
        are private, and exist only as part of this manager.

    A LogicManager never changes after it is created, so one instance can
    safely serve every request.
