    Logic owns the scoring rules, but the AI Manager is the one talking to
    Gemini. So main.py hands the AI Manager one of these objects:

    * ``instructions()`` gives the formula and tier rules for the prompt.
    * ``verify()`` checks Gemini's arithmetic and tier before the reply is
      accepted. The AI Manager retries a reply that fails, like bad JSON.

    The verifier uses a ScoreCalculator that it is given but does not own
    (association). Sharing one calculator with LogicManager means the prompt,
    the check and the evaluation can never disagree.
